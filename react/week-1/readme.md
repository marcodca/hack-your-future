# Homework Hack-Your-Future-CPH, React module Week 1
 <b>Task:</b>
 Render a basic static todo list with three items:
 ```
Todo List
 * Get out of bed, Wed Sep 13 2017
* Brush teeth, Thu Sep 14 2017
* Eat breakfast, Fri Sep 15 2017
```
 For each item render a description and a deadline date. Before you start draw a mockup and identify the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.
